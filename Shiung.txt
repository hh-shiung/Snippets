Testing out synchronizing updates of the "Original" remote repository to the "Personal" remote repository before getting it down to the "Local" repository.

Seems like the addition of "git remote add <name> <remote_repository_url>" is required to be done locally, pushed remotely, and synched remotely before doing it locally.
