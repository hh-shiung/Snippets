Hi, Shiung here!
Testing out the GitHub Synch thingy.

Meeting access denied errors from the direct clone, hence I'm forking it to my repository to try out pull requests!

Added in the WIP branch.
Commited the first commit to Masters.

Testing out synchronizing with an update remote "Original" repository.

Things to be added:
1. "git remote -v" to check current branches available of the local directory (file).
2. "git remote add <name> <original_remote_repository_URL>" if required. Meaning that only one remote repository listed.
3. "git fetch <original_remote_repository_NAME>" based on the names listed by "git remote -v" to synchronize the branch.
4. "git merge <name/branch> <personal_branch>" to merge changes of the "Original" repository branch to the local directory(file).
5. "git status", "git branch", and "git push" to checkout the changes before updating to the personal GitHub branch.
